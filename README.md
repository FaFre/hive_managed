# HiveManaged

HiveManaged is a super simple and easy to use highly-asynchronous library for database-synchronized objects. It is built upon [hive](https://github.com/hivedb/hive), the blazing-fast key-value database.
It handles **all** database-related stuff under the hood and appears as a fast sports car. Just access your variables with `get` and `set()` as you are used to.

> HiveManaged is still in alpha phase and under heavy development!
